CH3 Item Info is a Minecraft add-on that uses gametest. Gametest is a experimental framework that needs to be enabled in your world / realm / server.

## Usage
AddLore > scripts > CH3 > modules > lore.js
```js
world.events.tick.subscribe(() => {
  for(const player of world.getPlayers()) {
    const slot = player.selectedSlot;
    const newItem = player.getComponent("inventory").container.getItem(slot);
    if(newItem?.id != "minecraft:diamond_pickaxe") continue;
    newItem.setLore([
    `Â§eÂ§lMerchant: ${getScore(player, "Merchant")}`,
    `Â§bGem Finder: ${getScore(player, "GemFinder")}`
]);
    player.getComponent("minecraft:inventory").container.setItem(slot, newItem);
  }
});
```
This is where you can add an item to be given lore or add lore to the item in the template. For example if you add another element to the setLore array, it will add a new line. To stay on the same line you need to stay within the same element.
